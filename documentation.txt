//component build steps
    ng generate component 'name' 

    add html to template file 
        with content bindings 
        place to hold the other components 
            for instance
                ninja details
                sidebar 

    update the class file 

    update app.module 
        if there is a need for a new route 


//defining a class to give structure to data 
    in Angular = class is used to define structure of data objects
    think simple mongoose schema
     is a list 
        has 
            item : data type value

            typescript types 
                stirng
                number 
                boolean
                array 
                etc

//HTTP requests
    HTTP req runs ansynchronously 
    and return observables 
        since need to wait until data is complete
        need to convert observable to a promise 
            observables return chuncks of data 
            promises return a complete set 

    So data service can make 
        HTTP req and return 
            promises 

//Creating the method to get data 
    import the service into the component 
        Note ../ means "go up a level in the folder structure"
    
    inject it into the service 
        contructor(private service: Service) { }

//express
